# AdmitPredict

In this project, we determine each applicant’s chance of admission based on their results on two exams. We have historical data from previous applicants that we use as a training set for logistic regression. For each training example, we have the applicant’s scores on two exams and the admissions decision.

We build a classification model that estimates an applicant’s probability of admission based the scores from those two exams. 

After learning the parameters, we can use the model to predict whether a particular student will be admitted.
